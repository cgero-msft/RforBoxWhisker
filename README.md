# RforBoxWhisker

This is a basic few lines in R to show how to generate a box and whisker plot broken out across groups like months.

Also known as a boxplot, this visualization graphically depicts numerical data in quartiles. They are insightful when comparing the groups along the x-axis, to see patterns and shifting distributions between the groups.
